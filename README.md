# Hybrid Search for RAG Retrieval

This project demonstrates the use of Hybrid Search for LLM (Language Model) RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Retrieval. The following steps were followed in this project:

1. **Keyword Searching with BM25:** Utilizes the BM25 algorithm for traditional keyword-based searching, ranking documents based on the presence and weight of query terms.
2. **Semantic Search with Dense Embeddings:** Employs dense embeddings to capture semantic meanings and relationships, enabling the search for conceptually similar content.
3. **Hybrid Search:** Combines the strengths of keyword searching and semantic search to provide more accurate and comprehensive search results.

## Collaboration and Feedback

I am open to collaborations and welcome any feedback or suggestions. Feel free to leave a comment or reach out if you're interested in working together or have ideas to improve this project.
